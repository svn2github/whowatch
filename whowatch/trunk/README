Whowatch is an interactive console utility that displays informations about 
the users currently logged on to the machine, in real time. 
Besides standard information (login, tty, host, user's process) you can 
see type of login (ie. ssh, telnet). You can also see selected user's 
processes tree or all system processes tree.
In the process tree mode there is ability to send INT or KILL signal to
