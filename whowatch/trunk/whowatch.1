.SH NAME
whowatch \- watch logged in users and processes in real time
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBWhowatch\fR is an interactive ncurses who-like utility that displays information 
about the users currently logged on to the machine, in real-time.
Besides standard informations (login name, tty, host, user's process),
the type of the connection (ie. telnet or ssh) is shown.
Display of users command line can be switch to tty idle time.
Certain user can be selected and his processes tree may be viewed as well
as tree of all system processes. Tree may be displayed with additional
column that shows owner of each process.
In the process tree mode SIGINT and SIGKILL signals can be sent to the 
selected process. Killing processes is just as simple and fun as deleting
lines on the screen.

.SH FILES
Program reads \fI/var/log/wtmp\fR, \fI/var/run/utmp\fR. Under Linux program
also reads files from
\fI/proc\fR directory. Without read access to these files \fBwhowatch\fR
funcionality will be limited or program will not even start.

.SH "BUGS"
Because lack of ut_pid in utmp and wtmp structures
in *BSD systems, program tries to obtain pid of a login shell by analizing
processes controlling terminal and processes names. Under some conditions
it may lead to incorrect results ie. there will be incorrect processes
tree associated with user's session.
